            I've used AngularJS a lot over the past couple of years and I've found more often than not that there are at least 3 different way of accomplishing the same thing. I've always thought a guide of how best to use it would be helpful. So here it is.

                    <h2 id="feature-driven-development">Feature Driven Development</h2>
<p>See: http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-growth-structure/</p>

<p>Feature driven development is more about how you organise and structure your application than how you code the functionality. Rather than produce 1 large complicated app you create discreet pieces and couple them together. </p>

<h3 id="by-type---no">By type - No</h3>
<p>Files organised by type means having your controllers, services, <br />
filters, directives, views etc. placed in their respective folders. <br />
Nothing is discrete, development and testing is done in large <br />
blocks. Large applications quickly become overly complex.</p>

<pre><code>|
|- controllers
|--- controllers.mod.js
|--- home.ctrl.js
|--- about.ctrl.js
|--- contact.ctrl.js
|--- login.ctrl.js
|- services
|--- auth.svc.js
</code></pre>

<h3 id="by-feature---yes">By Feature - Yes</h3>
<p>The application is organised by the self-contained features that it<br />
requires. Each feature can be plugged into or out of the application<br />
with relative ease. It is not baked directly into the application’s<br />
foundations. Both development and testing is conducted within the<br />
scope of each feature.</p>

<pre><code>|
|- home
|--- home.mod.js
|--- home.ctrl.js
|- about
|--- about.mod.js
|--- about.ctrl.js
|- contact
|--- contact.mod.js
|--- contact.ctrl.js
|- login
|--- login.mod.js
|--- login.ctrl.js
|--- auth.svc.js
</code></pre>

<p><strong>See the <a href="http://grumpywizards.com/ngTemplate">ngTemplate project</a> <br />
for an example of how to organise your application and what each <br />
directory is used for.</strong></p>

<h2 id="module-declaration">Module Declaration</h2>
<p>Modules should be declared using the global <code>angular</code> variable like so:</p>

<pre><code>// app module
angular.module('demo', [
               'demo.features.login'
]);

// sub-module
angular.module('demo.features.login');
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>No additional globabl variables are required</li>
  <li>You can access your modules from everywhere </li>
  <li>Modules can be placed into different files</li>
  <li>You can use the function-form of <code>use strict</code>;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>See: http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.services.managing_dependencies</p>

<p>There are two types of dependencies you can include in your modules <br />
and controllers. The first is listing your required modules and the<br />
second is injecting services into your controllers.</p>

<h3 id="requiring-modules">Requiring modules</h3>

<pre><code>angular.module('demo', [
               'demo.features.login
])
</code></pre>

<p>This is a fairly standard process of how we require modules in AngularJS. <br />
Naming conventions are covered in the next section but you can see here <br />
that required modules should be grouped by feature.</p>

<h3 id="injecting-dependencies">Injecting dependencies</h3>

<p>Should be done explicity to prevent errors during minification and disjointed<br />
dependencies within your code.</p>

<pre><code>.controller('homeCtrl', ['$scope', '$state', function ($scope, $state) { }])
</code></pre>

<h2 id="naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>It is important to provide distinct names to components of your <br />
application. This mitigates the possibility that the angular source,<br />
3rd party libraries and shared components will have clashing module <br />
names, giving unexpected results.</p>

<h3 id="prefixing">Prefixing</h3>
<p>All components (directives, controllers, services) must be<br />
prefixed with an identifier that is relevant to their scope:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if shared across all applications use a company prefix: ‘wiz’ for Grumpy<br />
Wizards for example.</li>
  <li>if exclusive to an application use an application prefix: ‘todo’ if<br />
Grumpy Wizards built a todo list app for example.</li>
  <li><em>controllers do not need to be prefixed</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="postfixing">Postfixing</h3>
<p>The following component types should be postfixed as per the examples below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Controllers: MarkdownCtrl</li>
  <li>Services: wizMarkdownSvc</li>
  <li>Filters: wizMarkdownFltr</li>
  <li>Directives: do not require postfixing wizMarkdown &gt; becomes <code>wiz-markdown</code> in markup.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="capitalisation">Capitalisation</h3>
<p>Controllers are considered classes and as such they should have a leading<br />
capital letter: MarkdownCtrl, all other components should start with lower<br />
case e.g. wizMarkdown.</p>

<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Module namespacing format should following this pattern:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;application&gt;.&lt;[api,component,feature,service]&gt;.&lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Examples:<br />
- wiz.service.addNumbers<br />
- todo.component.markdown<br />
- reader.todo.api.email<br />
- users.feature.about</p>

<h3 id="filenames">Filenames</h3>
<p>To aid readability in the solution the type of component should be <br />
appended to each file name, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dashboard.mod.js  - the module declaration</li>
  <li>dashboard.dir.js – a directive</li>
  <li>dashboard.svc.js – a service or factory</li>
  <li>dashboard.ctrl.js – a controller</li>
  <li>dashboard.flt.js – a filter </li>
  <li>dashboard.tpl.html – the template</li>
  <li>dashboard.spec.js – the unit tests</li>
  <li>dashboard.spec.conf.js – unit tests config</li>
  <li>dashboard.feature – cucumber specificiation for testing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="html-templates-and-logic">HTML Templates and Logic</h2>
<p>See: http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/templates</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An Angular template is the declarative specification that, <br />
along with information from the model and controller, becomes <br />
the rendered view that a user sees in the browser. It is the <br />
static DOM, containing HTML, CSS, and angular-specific elements <br />
and angular-specific element attributes. The Angular elements <br />
and attributes direct angular to add behaviour and transform <br />
the template DOM into the dynamic view DOM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AngularJS Team</p>

<p>Don’t write HTML in your JavaScript <em>(unless you are building <br />
a distributable directive where templateUrl won’t function <br />
correctly, or it’s an abstract state, see routing section)</em>.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.errorMsg = "&lt;strong&gt;Validation failed&lt;/strong&gt;";
</code></pre>

<p>Don’t use logic in your HTML templates, for example the <br />
following should not be done:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="alert" ng-show="players &gt; 20"&gt;Too many players&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You should declare a property or method on scope and use that <br />
to drive your HTML conditions.</p>

<p>Using a declarative approach to logic provides a more maintainable <br />
template. If we used <code>players &gt; 20</code> on multiple HTML elements it <br />
would create additional overhead if we were to update that <br />
condition. By encapsulating the logic in a property or method <br />
it provides both semantically correct mark-up and re-usability.</p>

<h2 id="directives">Directives</h2>
<p>See: http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive</p>

<p>Directives are a way to attach a specified behaviour to a DOM <br />
element or even to transform an element and its children.</p>

<h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>
<p>When you are decorating an existing element with new<br />
functionality, directives should be applied as attributes.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div wiz-mouse-over="move()"&gt;Can't touch this&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The directive in the example above calls the defined behaviour<br />
when a mouse moves over an element. It is generic, reusable and <br />
does not change the element beyond the bounds of the mouse event.</p>

<p>These directives should be developed in a generic way, with <br />
minimal understanding of the element content and can be used across <br />
an application.</p>

<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>
<p>When creating self-contained components, you should use the element <br />
notation. This allows us to describe functionality in templates by <br />
applying directives as a <strong>domain specific language</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;wiz-markdown&gt;&lt;/wiz-markdown&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Each element is responsible for delivering its described functionality <br />
and should have ‘replace’ set to true in order to tidy up the html <br />
after they are compiled.</p>

<p>The parent template is more descriptive and easier to maintain as you <br />
can simply switch functionality on or off by adding or removing the element.</p>

<p>Element directives should be placed alongside their corresponding feature. </p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>
<p>See: http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filter</p>

<p>Filters should be organised in accordance to their parent features, <br />
unless they are designed to provide commonly accessible functionality.</p>

<h3 id="performance-of-filters">Performance of filters</h3>
<p>Angular continuously conducts “dirty-checking”, in essence it is <br />
looking for changes to values over and over again and raising events <br />
for $watch and $filter to hook into. If you place a filter on your <br />
HTML page like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-bind="item.amount | roundDown"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Don’t be surprise if it starts at some point executing A LOT repeatedly.<br />
If you place the above code inside a repeater you are essentially <br />
increasing the filter execution by a factor of the number of items <br />
within the repeater’s array.</p>

<p>If possible, you should apply filters to your data before binding to your view</p>

<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>Services are responsible for the business logic in your application.</p>

<p>UI logic, when to disable a button for example, should not be <br />
carried out in a service.</p>

<p><strong>See the <a href="http://grumpywizards.com/ngTemplate">ngTemplate project</a> for<br />
further info on where to place your business logic</strong></p>

<h2 id="routers">Routers</h2>
<p>See: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router</p>

<h3 id="angularui-router">AngularUI Router</h3>
<p>All routing should be conducted using AngularUI Router. AngularUI <br />
Router is an external plugin used to convert your application into<br />
a state machine. ngRoute uses the URL to drive navigation. uiRouter <br />
reverses your app’s relationship with the URL. It uses states to<br />
navigate and it drives changes to the URL rather than the URL driving <br />
changes to your app.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router">Please familiarise yourself with the AngularUI <br />
Router documentation</a></p>
