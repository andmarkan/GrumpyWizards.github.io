intro: "So many sites use Markdown (mainly because it's awesome!), so why not see how we could integrate a markdown solution into an Angular app? This is my take on it, hopefully you'll see that it is flexible and de-coupled. Download the zip and run the webpage and see how easy it is to use. This plugin uses MarkdownDeep behind the scenes."
